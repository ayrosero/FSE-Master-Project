# FSE-Master-Project
Group 4 repository for Project Spyn.  
Class: 73827
  
Implementation 1: Main Body - 10/22

## Programs guide:  
ConnectToEV3.m -- Connect script. Make sure that the brick is renamed to '73827GROUP4' before using bluetooth.  
KeyboardTester1.m -- Basic manual driving script. No sensors, just control driving and arm movement.  
KeyboardTester3Sensors.m -- Has *some* sensor code. **WORK IN PROGRESS!!!** Check the files in Canvas for how to collect data from sensors.  

FirstTry.m -- First official no-manual controls attempt. **WORK IN PROGRESS!!!**  
SecondTry.m -- Second official update. Has some code for the color sensors and touch sensor, but no distance sensor yet. **WIP!!!**  
FourthTry.m -- Fourth official update. I don't know what to say for the 3rd one. This is probably going to be the last major update before demo day.  

## PDFs key:  
Personal Machine Software Install-1.pdf -- This is for downloading the required software. Look at this first.  
Introduction_to_MATLAB-1.pdf -- This is for learning the basics of MATLAB and its syntax.  
Introduction to EV3-1.pdf -- This has some useful code for the EV3 brick, like how to connect the brick, etc.  
Keyboard Control-1.pdf -- This shows how to use keyboard control.  
Sensors-1.pdf -- This shows how to use the sensors and read data.  
  
If there's anything else, check the page in Canvas with all the pdf's for instructions: setup, connecting to bluetooth, etc.
